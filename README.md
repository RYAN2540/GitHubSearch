GitHub Library is an app that allows one to search for GitHub users and repositories. It consumes data from GitHub API enabling one to view a searched user's profile i.e. the name, repositories, and more; and searched repository details i.e description, license, last updated, among other details. On the landing page, GitHub library gives you the profile of the developer. Navigate to search for users and repos. Each user profile and repo has links to content on GitHub. These links highlight on hover.
